### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on myself haha and also trying to become proficient in coding.

**Other interesting things I do in my free time:**

 - I learn languages. My main focus at the moment is German 🇩🇪 but I also want to learn Spanish 🇪🇸
  - I like dancing in my free time and I go to Reggeaton classes 🕺
    
⚡ Fun fact: I love cooking spaghetti Bolognese 🍝
